# Introduction

In this project, we explored the world of instant noodles, aka ramen. Our data set is from the Ramen Rater website created by a single ramen enthusiast, with over 2500 reviews on all kinds of instant noodles one can possibly find in stores. We are interested in what features are important for predicting a ramen's rating.

# Data Set

Each observation in the data set is a review for a single ramen product. The features include a review number, where bigger number represents a more recent review, the brand, the product's name, its manufacturing country, packing style (such as cup or bowl), and star ratings, which range from 0 to 5 inclusively with 0.25 increments. Note that the stars represent the reviewer's personal taste and are a very subjective scoring.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Before going into the formal analysis, 

```{r predictor-distributions, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1. Origins of Ramen Products", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/ramen_map.png")
```
