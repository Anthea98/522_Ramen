# Ramen Star Prediction

+ Contributors: Allyson Stoll, Irene Yan, Wenjia Zhu, Xiaohan Chen

This is a project for MDS 522 Group6.

## About

We will use the StandardScaler(), CountVector() and other method to transform the data and build a linear regression model which can predict a Ramen restaurant's star based on its brand, variety,style, countries and other indicators. And we can also get some conclusions like What ingredients or flavors are most commonly advertised on ramen package labels? in this process. The star scales from 0 to 5, representing how tasty the Ramen will be. This question may not be of the world-changing kind, but it is a good start of figuring out a result in real-life problems with data science for us. Considering the usefulness of this model for food lovers around the world when choosing nearby ramen restaurants, we think this is a very interesting and meaningful question.

The dataset we used in this project is downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/ramen-ratings), created by the data analysist called Aleksey Bilogur. Each record in the dataset is a single ramen product review.
