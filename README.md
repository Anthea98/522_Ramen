Ramen (ラーメン) is a noodle soup dish that was originally imported from China
 and has become one of the most popular dishes in Japan in recent decades.
Ramen are inexpensive and widely available, two factors that also make them 
an ideal option for budget travelers. Ramen restaurants, or ramen-ya, can 
be found in virtually every corner of the country and produce countless regional 
variations of this common noodle dish.
